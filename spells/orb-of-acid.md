&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orb of acid about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d6 points of 
acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A create struck by the orb takes damage and becomes sickened by the acid's noxious fumes for 1 
round. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect but does not reduce the damage.
